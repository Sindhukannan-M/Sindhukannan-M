## 👋 Hey, I’m Sindhu

### Data Science | Machine Learning | NLP | Deep Learning | OpenCV | MLops

I like asking **why** before jumping to **how**.  
Whether it’s statistics, data analysis, or machine learning, I focus on understanding what’s happening **under the hood** and making sense of data that actually matters.

### 🔹 I specialize in
- Strong foundation in **statistics, probability, and data analysis**
- **Data cleaning, exploration, and feature engineering** on real datasets
- Building and understanding **machine learning models** 
- Working with **NLP** for text analysis and prediction tasks
- Conceptual understanding of **deep learning architectures**
- Writing clean, structured **Python code** with a problem-first approach

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **NLP & CV:** Text processing, feature extraction, OpenCV  

### 🔹 Collaboration
- Enjoy working in teams where ideas, feedback, and learning flow freely  
- Value clean code, clear thinking, and ownership of work  

📌 Open to opportunities where I can apply my skills, grow through real problems, and contribute to impactful data-driven solutions

I stay committed to keeping up with evolving trends in data science and understanding them in depth rather than at a surface level. This approach helps me adapt in a rapidly changing field and apply my skills thoughtfully when working on real-world problems and opportunities.
